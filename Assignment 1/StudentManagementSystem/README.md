## Objective

- To create a student management system using java servlet and JSP

## Theory

- `JSP, or JavaServer Pages`, is a technology for creating dynamic web pages using Java. It allows developers to embed Java code within HTML pages, which are then processed on the server and transformed into HTML pages that can be sent to the client's web browser.
- JSP provides a simplified and fast way of creating dynamic web pages, as compared to writing Servlets directly. JSP pages are composed of two main elements: static HTML, and dynamic content written in the form of JSP tags and expressions.

## Steps

- Create a `dynamic web project` inside the **Eclipse IDE**. *Note: check the generate web xml file when creating the project*
- Create a package as `com.sms`.
- Create these folders `controller, dao, dto, service, util` inside `com.sms`.
- Create the respective `java` or `interface` file 
- Create the `JSP` files inside `src/main/webapp` folder as 
- Run the project.

## Steps to create a server

1. Download the `Tomcat server` of apache from internet.
2. Go to the `window` menu of Eclispe IDE and select the `Show View` submenu and click on the `servers` option.
3. A window will appear at the bottom, right click on the window and create a new server.
    - For that select the apache tomcat server version you downloaded from a pop up window that will appear.
    - Give the path to the tomcat bin folder
4. Right click the newely created server and click run server.
